# Breaking Bad Quote Generator

## Description

This application uses JavaScript to randomly grab one of several dozen quotes from characters from the show _Breaking Bad_ and its spin-off _Better Call Saul_. Both of which are shows I and many of you probably are tremendously fond of.

### How to use this application

This app works automatically as soon as it's finished loading in the browser. A quote is immediately fetched from the [Breaking Bad API](https://www.breakingbadapi.com/api/). The quote and its author's name are then dynamically inserted into the HTML. Below the quote and the author is a button that when clicked will restart the whole process and fetch another quote. This will allow the user to fetch and see as many of the several dozen quotes as they desire.
